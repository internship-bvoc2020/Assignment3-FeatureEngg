# Assignment3-FeatureEngg

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis , Data Cleaning & Feature Engg on the Training dataset 
 
* Idenitfy & Remove the field that is providing only unique information about records .Capture it in another dataframe 

* Identifying Continous & Categorical Columns

* Performing Uni-variate Analysis with Plots.Record your Observations

* Perform Bi-variate Analysis among all Independent variables.Draw appropriate Plots , mention observations 

* Perform Bi-variate Analysis between Target Variable and each Independent variable. Use suitable plot , mention observations.trends etc

* How is the class distribution (Y/N) in Label(Target) Variable ?

* Identify the Independent Variables that have missing values.

* Handle missing values appropriately , explain the technique applied for each case

* Identify the Outliers in each Independent Variable.Distribute the data in each field using Quartile bins (0-25%,25%-50%,50%-75%,75%-100% iles)

* Use Box-Plot chart to represent the Outliers for each Independent Variable

* Perform treatment of these Outliers using appropriate techniqies.Explain your approach

Step 1 -
* Perform Label Encoding on Target Variable (Loan_Status). 

Step 2-
Using dataframe from Step 1:
* Perform Label Encoding on Categorical Independent Variables.
* What is the shape of dataframe post Categorical Encoding ?
* Carry out Correlation analysis on this dataframe. Plot using HeatMap
* Identify the variables that have strong correlation using Label Encoding( Correlation Coefficient > 0.5 or <0.5)

Step 3 -
Using dataframe from Step 1:
* Perform One Hot Encoding on Categorical Independent Variables.
* What is the shape of dataframe post OHE Encoding ?
* Carry out Correlation analysis on this dataframe. Plot using HeatMap
* Identify the variables that have strong correlation using OHE ( Correlation Coefficient > 0.5 or <0.5)
